# Validator kit

## Overview

This repository contains the validator kit for Mezo chain. The validator kit is a collection of tools and documentation to help you run a validator node on Mezo chain. There are a couple of main components of the validator kit:

1) Docker Compose - contains files to run a validator node using Docker. This is the recommended way to run a validator node as it requires less setup and maintenance.

2) Native Binary - contains files to fetch the `mezod` binary from a remote repository and run it manually. This is an alternative way to run a validator node if you prefer to run it natively.

3) Tools Hardhat - this toolset provides a collection of Hardhat tasks designed to simplify interactions with the blockchainâ€™s Proof-of-Authority (PoA) based network. E.g. you can submit your application to become one of the PoA validators.

As a validator you can chose between option 1) and 2) to run your validator node. Point 3) is common for both. In other words as a validator you can follow 1) -> 3) OR 2) -> 3) flow.
